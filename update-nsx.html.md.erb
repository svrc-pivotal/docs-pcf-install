title: Updating NSX Security Group and Load Balancer Information
owner: Ops Manager

<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes how to update security group and load balancer information for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) deployments using NSX-V on vSphere. To update this information, you must use the Ops Manager API. 

See the Ops Manager API documentation at `https://YOUR-OPS-MANAGER-FQDN/docs` for more information about the API.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Ops Manager v1.11 supports NSX-V 6.2+.</p>

## <a id='authenticate'></a> Authenticate

To use the Ops Manager API, you must authenticate and retrieve a token from the Ops Manager User Account and Authentication (UAA) server. For instructions, see the [Using Ops Manager API](ops-man-api.html) topic.

## <a id='update'></a> Update Security Group or Load Balancer Information

To update either NSX security group or load balancer information, you use `curl` to make a PUT request against the `api/v0/staged/products/product_guid/jobs/job_guid/resource_config` endpoint. 

You must first retrieve the GUID of your PCF deployment, and the GUID of the job whose information you want to update.

Perform the following steps: 

1. Retrieve a list of staged products:
	<pre class="terminal">
	$ curl 'http<span>s</span>://OPS-MAN-FQDN/api/v0/staged/products' \
	-H "Authorization: Bearer UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN"
	[
	   {
	      "product\_version" : "1.10.6.0",
	      "guid" : "p-bosh-dee11e111e1111ee1e1a",
	      "installation\_name" : "p-bosh",
	      "type" : "p-bosh"
	   },
	   {
	      "type" : "cf",
	      "product\_version" : "1.10.8-build.7",
	      "installation\_name" : "cf-01222ab1111111aaa1a",
	      "guid" : "cf-01222ab1111111aaa1a"
	   }
	]
	</pre>

	Record the GUID of the `cf` product. In the above example, the GUID is `cf-01222ab1111111aaa1a`.

1. Retrieve a list of jobs for your product:
	<pre class='terminal'>
	$ curl 'http<span>s</span>://OPS-MAN-FQDN/api/v0/staged/products/PRODUCT-GUID/jobs' \
	-H "Authorization: Bearer UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN'
	{
   "jobs" : [
      {
         "guid" : "consul\_server-9c37cf48ae7412f2afd1",
         "name" : "consul\_server"
      },
      {
         "name" : "nats",
         "guid" : "nats-6af18efdd18d198edee9"
      },
      {
         "name" : "nfs\_server",
         "guid" : "nfs\_server-b49b0b2aed247302c0e1"
      },
      ...
	</pre>

	Record the GUID of the job whose security groups you want to update. 

1. You can update either your security group information, load balancer information, or both.
	* **Security groups**: To update the security groups for your job, use the following command:
		<pre class="terminal">
		$ curl "http<span>s</span>://OPS-MAN-FQDN/api/v0/staged/products/PRODUCT-GUID/jobs/JOB-GUID/resource\_config" \ 
		    -X PUT \ 
                    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
		    -H "Authorization: Bearer UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN" \
		    -d '{"instance_type": {"id": "INSTANCE-TYPE"},
                         "nsx\_security\_groups": ["SECURITY-GROUP1", "SECURITY-GROUP2"]}'
		</pre>
		Replace INSTANCE-TYPE with the instance type for the job, or "automatic" for the default instance type.  The value for `nsx_security_groups` is a list of the security groups you want to set for the job. To clear all security groups for a job, pass an empty list with the value `[]`.
		<br><br>
	* **Load balancers**: To update the load balancers for your job, use the following command:
		<pre class="terminal">
		$ curl "http<span>s</span>://OPS-MAN-FQDN/api/v0/staged/products/PRODUCT-GUID/jobs/JOB-GUID/resource\_config" \ 
		    -X PUT \ 
                    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
		    -H "Authorization: Bearer UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN" \
		    -d '{"instance_type": {"id": "INSTANCE-TYPE"},
                                    "nsx\_lbs": [{
				      "edge\_name": "EDGE-NAME", 
				      "pool\_name": "POOL-NAME", 
				      "security\_group": "SECURITY-GROUP", 
				      "port": "PORT-NUMBER" 
				    }]
                       }'
		</pre>
		Replace INSTANCE-TYPE with the instance type for the job, or "automatic" for the default instance type.  Replace the placeholder values under `nsx_lbs` as follows:

		* `EDGE-NAME`: The name of the NSX Edge
		* `POOL-NAME`: The name of the NSX Edge's server pool
		* `SECURITY-GROUP`: The name of the NSX server pool's target security group
		* `PORT`: The name of the port that the VM service is listening on, such as `5000`

               More than one load balancer may be configured for a job by adding more of these hashes to the `nsx_lbs` array.

1. Navigate to `OPS-MAN-FQDN` in a browser and log in to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.

1. Click **Apply Changes** to redeploy.
